# Extractive Text Summarization Script

## Overview

This Python script implements **extractive text summarization**, a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that condenses long articles into concise, meaningful summaries. By analyzing the text, it identifies and extracts the most important sentences, helping users quickly grasp the key points without reading the entire content.

## Features

- Splits input text into sentences and words for detailed analysis
- Filters out common stopwords to focus on meaningful words
- Builds a frequency map to score word importance within the text
- Uses Python’s built-in libraries such as:
  - `re` for regular expressions (text processing)
  - `heapq` for efficient ranking and extraction of top sentences
- Extracts and returns the top-ranked sentences as a summary

## Why This Matters

This project deepened my understanding of core NLP concepts and demonstrated how simple, efficient algorithms can transform raw text into actionable insights. It’s especially useful for full-stack engineers working on text-heavy applications like:

- News aggregators
- Chatbots
- Content management systems

By integrating this summarization script, developers can create smarter, user-friendly features that enhance information accessibility and improve overall user experience.
